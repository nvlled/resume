        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I am hobbyist who has a wide range of interest, including math and programming.
            I am not openly competitive, but for purposes of knowing my current edge and
            limitations I do try to measure myself against other people who are in the same
            competing space. I still have lots to learn, but I also actively don't try
            beat myself too much up if I hardly make an inch towards my mutable goals.

            <li>Automated Code Testing − Write tests is my least favorite part of developement, but as I do write them as needed and if the requirements are no longer highly-variable and are well-defined.</li>

            <h3>Doctrac</h3>
            <p>
                A university document tracking system.
                It remains to be seen what the future of this
                project is since partly the stakeholders couldn't form
                a definite consensus on the process, and partly because
                I couldn't deliver on designated times.
            </p>
            <h4>Technologies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PHP/laravel</strong> −
                This is only the second time I've used laravel, the first one
                was for a project assignment, so my code wasn't idiomatic
                to the conventions used by the laravel developers. The major
                pain point I experienced with laravel is the java-ish design
                pattern coding conventions used. I personally find it needlessly
                complicated, and more often than not it was tedious to adapt the
                framework to my problem.
                </li>
                <li><strong>jQuery</strong> −
                I'm actually more of a vanilla js guy who uses DOM API directly,
                but I've used jQuery because the would-be maintainer is familiar with it.
                For quick page interactivity, jQuery is a good tool, but for really
                complex UI, it starts to devolve to spaghetti code.
                </li>
                <li><strong>domvmjs</strong> −
                I rewrote a really complex and messy jQuery UI code in domvm,
                which made the code simpler and maintainable.
                There are lots of trending vdom libraries now
                (such as react and vue) but I chose this one
                since it's a small library with no dependencies.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bootstrap 4</strong> −
                I actually rewrote the site interface design twice before finally
                succumbing to bootstrap. Interface and layout design is my weakness,
                and it's hard to it right even with css grid and flexbox.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Cbtest</h3>
            <p>
                A (web) computer-based test and exam for technical drafting.
                Notable features include automatically grading drafts by
                comparing images, and automated test score grading and compilation.
            </p>
            <h4>Technologies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>node/express</strong> −
                I've used this for the backend, which is a standard
                choice since express is a good enough for most backend stuffs.
                I'd like to get a chance to develop SPA with react or vue
                and see what the developer affordance and ergonomics they provide.
                </li>
                <li><strong>HTML5 with pug and CSS Grid/Flexbox</strong> −
                I learned and tried using CSS grids since the client
                had specific requests for layout design. I've managed
                to fulfill the request, but working with CSS grid
                was cumbersome since it behaves differently on browsers.
                But it's possible that the
                layout was really complex or that I haven't fully
                learned how to utilize CSS grids properly.

                <li><strong>Plain JS/ES5</strong> −
                For the client scripts,
                I don't need much page interactivity so I resorted to
                just using plain DOM API and ES5 for optimal compatibility.
                </li>
                <li><strong>iSpring Suite 8</strong> −
                This is a plugin for MS Powerpoint for creating
                interactive test/exam materials. This is what the client
                was already using, and I needed to implement automation
                for the manual processes.
                I needed to programmatically modify the code generated by ispring,
                but it does not provide an SDK, so I just did a little reverse
                engineering on the base64 blob embedded in the script.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Image Diff Library</strong> −
                I forked and modified an image diffing library
                so I could count the number
                of pixel differences between two images.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Trending scanpath analyzer</h3>
            <p>
                This is a work from a PhD student who
                needed automation from the current manual
                MS Excel computations. The problem domain
                involves taking a group of files generated
                by an eye-tracker device, and then
                finding a trending scanpath from a group of
                student participants. The full problem domain
                is a bit out of my knowledge scope, but my
                implementation have a formal document/specification
                to refer to.
            </p>
            <h4>Technologies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python with PyQt5</strong> −
                I don't have much exposure to python aside
                from when I was learning to program, but
                it's a nice language/tool that I definitely
                use more in the future. I had a bit of trouble
                setting up the python environment, but I managed
                through with virtualenv, which works seamlessly
                with windows and linux.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Qt5 with Qt Designer</strong> −
                I don't have much luxury time learning another layout
                system, so having WYSIWYG interface tool such as Qt Designer
                is a big help.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pyinstaller</strong> −
                I used this to make standalone executable binaries.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Dilim</h3>
            <p>
                Digital Library Management.
                This is a work from my sister who is a highschool
                teacher and is assigned on managing a library.
                Her primary complaint is creating DDC call numbers
                for the books.
            </p>
            <h4>Technologies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Electron JS</strong> −
                Electron is a nice technology in creating
                cross-platform apps, but I sort of dislike
                the bloated application size.
                </li>
                <li><strong>NPM Libraries</strong> −
                I had to write two libraries for the generation
                of DDC call numbers since there were none in
                the npm, the one I could find was a windows GUI
                app.
